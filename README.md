This matlab code reproduces and confirms the calculation showed in the article: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11879 submitted for pubblication.

To run the code:
 1. Dowload the folder and leave the same file structure.
 2. From the folder 'position' run position_sim_teoVSemp.m to generate the theorical and empirical density of the position.
 3. From the folder 'stopping' run stopping_sim_teoVSemp.m to generate the theorical and empirical distribution of the First Passage Time.
